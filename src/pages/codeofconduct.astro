    <br />
    <p>
      This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the
      Orlando Devs community (relevant to both our Slack and Meetup), as well as
      steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a
      welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct
      to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from
      the community.

    <div class="py-3 mt-2">
      <p class="mb-2">Our open source community strives to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-4 list-inside px-8">
        <li>
          <strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be welcoming:</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes
          and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but
          is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin,
          color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level,
          sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family
          status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be considerate:</strong> Your actions (and words) affect users
          and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember
          that we’re a very diverse community, so you might not be communicating
          in someone else’s primary language.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be respectful:</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time,
          but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might
          all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that
          frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember
          that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a
          productive one.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be careful in the words that we choose:</strong> We are a community
          of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others.
          Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
          behavior aren’t acceptable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Try to understand why we disagree:</strong> Disagreements, both
          social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve
          disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different.
          The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide
          range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues.
          Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that
          they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other
          doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and
          learning from mistakes.

          inappropriate levels of intimacy with others

        <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
        <li>
          Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their

      <p>
        We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a
        community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat
        everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant
        has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If
        someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen
        carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity
        in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity,
        language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race,
        religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical
        ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the
        protected characteristics above, including participants with
        disabilities.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2 underline">Reporting Issues</h2>
      <p>
        If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other
        concerns—please report it by contacting us using via:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-4 my-4 list-inside px-8">
        <li>
          <strong>Slack:</strong> Use this command:<span
            class="bg-slate-200 text-black">/admin your message</span
          > on anywhere on Slack to privately report incidents, and a moderator will
          get in touch with you promptly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Meetup & other events:</strong> Speak privately in person with
          organizers at events, or email organizers via Meetup.com
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please
        include:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-4 my-4 list-inside px-8">
        <li>Your contact information.</li>
        <li>
          Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If
          there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your
          account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing.
          If there is a publicly available record, please include a link.
        </li>
        <li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally,
        review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a
        decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is
        part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling
        your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response
        team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We
        will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting
        victims of abuse.
