title: Orlando PHP
---

The Orlando PHP Meetup is open to anyone excited about or wanting to learn more about the PHP programming language.
PHP is used as a foundation for web frameworks such as Laravel and Symfony, as well as content management systems (CMSs) such as WordPress and Drupal. It is ubiquitously used in modern web application development.
We meet periodically and provide expert talks, a friendly social atmosphere, snacks and refreshments, and networking opportunities.
All skill levels are welcome; students and learners are encouraged to attend.
