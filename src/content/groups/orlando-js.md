The Orlando JavaScript group is a place to talk about all things JavaScript. Our mission is to facilitate networking of professionals and enthusiasts. We hold monthly meetups on various topics around the JavaScript ecosystem. ALL LEVELS ARE WELCOME, especially those who are just getting started with coding and would like to learn more about the software industry. 

We are always looking for companies to collaborate with. If your company is interested in sponsoring our group, please reach out to one of us organizers.

Hope to see you on our next meetup!
