# Details

Come prepared with some ideas or just listen in. Lean Coffee is a quick Kanban style of organizing technical discussions for 10-15 people across many topics. We'll start discussing and voting on the topics by 7:15 and go until we run out (or we're past closing time).

All are welcome, whether you're currently working full-time in DevOps or are just passively curious.

They do have "provisions" there, so feel free to check out the menu on [their website](https://www.homestatebrew.com/).
