# Details

Happy new year to our JS community! What better way to celebrate than coming together to enjoy chicken tenders (veg options available) and brainstorming ideas on what our community wants from these meetups. Help us shape the future of JS in Orlando tech scene.

Bring your friends to network and chat with other javascript developers that reside in the central Florida area!
