This is a great place for juniors to come and ask all the questions that keeps them up at night. Such as, what do juiors do, what is exxpected of them, what they can do to stand out, good habits to develop to ensure growth and recognition and how long it takes for juinors to move up to a mid level role. If this sounds like it's right up your alley, then come join us for a night of food and networking and get to know your fellow juniors!
